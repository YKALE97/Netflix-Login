Front-End Testing with Selenium and TestNG Project.

Automated Testing Project with Selenium and TestNG
This repository showcases an automated testing project that includes two main components:

Netflix Login Automation with Test Case Documentation

A test case for automating the Netflix login process.
A detailed test case document providing step-by-step instructions for automating the login.
Automated Script for Homepage Verification (Java & TestNG)

An automated script created in Java with TestNG to verify the homepage content of the https://www.pairviewtraining.com/ website. The script checks if the website's homepage matches the expected string: "Build a career in a fast-growing field. Only at Pairview | Pairview Training."
